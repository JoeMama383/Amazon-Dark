# AmazonDark v6.0.129 probe

Built directly from v6.0.128 after the standalone-ad scope/glyph patch produced no visible change.

This is diagnostic-only. Production behavior is intentionally unchanged from v6.0.128. The probe captures the exact live DOM and computed paint ownership for visible `Sponsored` labels, nearby info-glyph candidates, the nearest ad shell, child media/iframes, and active TWB markers when the app backgrounds.

No new MutationObserver, scroll listener, interval, requestAnimationFrame loop, or recurring scan is added. The older component-shell diagnostic hook is replaced with a no-op during mutations; the actual scan runs only when the existing native background exporter asks for a dump.

## Reproduction
1. Open Home and scroll to the standalone horizontal ad with the lighter full-width rectangle.
2. Background Amazon once.
3. Return to Amazon and open a product/search submenu containing the standalone sponsored ad whose photo-only taming is correct.
4. Background Amazon again.
5. Export `/tmp/AmazonDark-standalone-ad-probe-6129.txt` (the exact tmp prefix can vary on iOS; use the provided shell command from ChatGPT).
